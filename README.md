# BUK SHOP
## Interactive Web Development Project I | CCT College 3rd Year 

As part of Interactive Web Development module of the IT degree, students were required to create and develop a online store which would allow the 
user to control the stock by adding and removing products, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and XML.

For this project, I developed an online bookshop using Charles Bukowski as a personal inspiration for the visual interface and his books as content 
and title for the products.

Minimum requirements:
- Develop a layout;
- Use xml to hold any necessary information;
- Create functions to add and remove products.

Achievements:
- Resposive layout developed using HTML and CSS;
- Interactive options to add and remove titles working fine;
- Option to updtae titles not developed.
